    "dialogue": "Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake. Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that...."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",

  },
  {
    "character": "Joanna",
    "dialogue": "Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in it's drawer. If you must know the truth, I didn't want to lose a perfectly good assistant."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joanna",
    "dialogue": "That's why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinking..."

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",

  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like it's snowballing, y'know?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "All right, I've got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, I'm getting the feeling that you don't want to deliver."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Okay. I'm guessing that if you don't want to deliver, you probably don't want to pick stuff up either."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Y'know what, it'd be, it'd be fun."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. Y'know what, I want you to take the chef job."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Umm, I just wanna say, uh that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... Are you gonna kill me?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "How can she be great if she's from Poughkeepsie? That joke would've killed in Albany."
  },

    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Hey, look at this! They're lighting the big Christmas tree tonight."

  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Well, I have a girlfriend, I'm-I'm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy."
  },

    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Well, wait a minute, you're the boss! Why don't you just yell at them? Or, fire them?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Yeah. Listen uh, I'd prefer it if you didn't call me Joey. Since I don't know anyone here, I thought it'd be cool to try out a cool work nickname."

    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "I don't get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did? Shh! We're trying to think!"

    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day."
  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",

  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "That's not why you're going! You're going because you hope he's gonna say, \"Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy.\""

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Well, maybe sometimes I find out things or I hear something and I pass that information on y'know kinda like a public service, it doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean, would you call Ted Kopel a gossip?"

    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Oh see, I-I needed a new thing for today and there's this leather store that always smells so good and I thought to myself, \"Wow, I never really owned a good smelling pair of pants before.\""

    "dialogue": "No, I-I got really hot in my leather pants so I took them off but they must have shrunk from the-the sweat or-or-or my legs expanded from the heat. Look, I-I can't put them back on. I can't!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Oh. That is quite a situation. Uh, do you see any like, powder?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Good-good, okay, sprinkle some of that on your legs, it'll absorb some of the moisture and then you can get your pants back up."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "They're still, they're still not coming on man and the lotion and the powder have made a paste!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Well, I'm just-if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference!"
  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Maybe I should get another pair! Ooh, y'know, they-they had some with fringe all down the sides. I'm gonna go kiss Ben goodnight. I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy. I would make a good cowboy."

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Oh no, my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories......about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke."

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Yeah, I had to teach Ross my bit because I actually didn't get a callback."
  },

    "character": "Rachel",

  },
  {
    "character": "The Casting Director",

  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "No, we-we're gonna be like best friends, that's why it's gonna be weird."

    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Is it okay if I leave this stuff here 'til Rachel's birthday party?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",

    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Y'know I rued the day once...didn't get a whole lot else done."

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich."

  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",

  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Uh well, I guess I'm not gonna miss the fact that you're never allowed to move the phone pen."

  },
  {

    "dialogue": "Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that you're really sarcastic, or that, y'know, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry."

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "OK, listen I've been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? It's a show, but we're just dancing, OK? It's no big deal. The important thing to remember &#150; stay cool."

    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "I mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know? I guess I'm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys."

    "dialogue": "We'll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth-me."
  },

    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",

  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back."

  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp."
  },

    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!"
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to face-And by face I don't mean his lap. And by face, I don't mean my ass."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?"
  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldn't move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?"
  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",

    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Y'know, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that we're trying to figure out her recipe. I bet she's l-l-lookin' up at us and smiling right now."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Well, I've tried everything. I give up. I guess I'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe. Kids love that right."
  },

  },
  {

    "dialogue": "Right. So I guess I shouldn't put good at noticing stuff on my resume."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",

  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something."

  },
  {
    "character": "The Casting Director",
    "dialogue": "Wait Joey! You didn't need to come down because the director saw your tape from yesterday and loved it."

  },
  {
    "character": "The Casting Director",
    "dialogue": "So uh well the director is insisting that whoever play that part be authentically, anatomically not Jewish. Do you know what I'm saying?"

  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",

  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",

  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list."

    "dialogue": "Thanks for letting me stay here! I mean Monica's place was nice, but her fiancee sure stares a lot."
  },
  {
    "character": "Cassie Geller",
    "dialogue": "I guess the last time we really hung out was when our parents rented that beach house together."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Oh right. Right. Ooh, remember the time I uh, I pinned you down and tickled you 'til you cried? We're probably too old to do that now."

    "character": "Cassie Geller",
    "dialogue": "I'll always remember that summer, because it's when I got all of these freckles."
  },

    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Well, I don't know. I called all the people in Monica's phone book and these are the only ones who could show up on 24 hours notice."

  },
  {
    "character": "Woman",
    "dialogue": "I'm very interested to find out who's been doing her taxes these last four years."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "No I wasn't! You were supposed to tell her to come and I was supposed to bring the cake!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Okay, we have a lot of options here, a number of prototypes for you to try on."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Yeah! Okay, this one is a mushroom cap. Umm, this one is made of bologna."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Okay? Over here we have pink suede, which is nice. But umm, if it gets wet then you know it's gonna shrink."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "I also, did a little something in fur. But umm, that's really just for me. Okay. So, why don't you go into your room and try these on and we'll see-get a better idea of what's gonna work."

  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",

  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Yeah, we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower, and now you don't have either."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Well no wait a minute that's not true! No, what did, that was really sweet. And it kinda works out for the best."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Well now, I get to spend my shower with the only people I really love! I mean, I get all those presents without having to talk to people I don't even like!"

  },
  {
    "character": "Melissa Warburton",
    "dialogue": "Oh no, that's-that's an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "No we weren't! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y'know, ended up...kissing for a bit."
  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Well, I'm sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y'know? Your parents are comin'! Chandler's parents are comin'! Ross's parents are comin'!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and if there's anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. But these are the three that Monica pre-approved."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Well, thanks a lot for hookin' me up Rach. I want you to know that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me. They...feel a little unwanted."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Come on! Look just-just tell-let her know that you really want them to be there. Let's not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Yeah! Y'know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning."
  },

    "character": "Melissa Warburton",
    "dialogue": "Oh, isn't a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",

  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Chandler, you're not fourteen anymore. Okay? Maybe it's time that you let that stuff go. If your father's not at your wedding...you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life."

    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "No, it's not! We were just goofing around and I dared him to try them on."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "I think so too. And that little flap? Great for holding my lipstick."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "And! Y'know what Jake says? That women's underwear is actually more comfortable. And he loves the way the silk feels against his skin."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Yeah well next thing you know, he'll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "There is nothing wrong with Jake! Okay? He is all man! I'm thinking even more than you."
  },

    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Oh yeah, he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "I'm just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women's underwear! I don't think you could ever do that."
  },

    "character": "Monica",

  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "No! No! I don't want him to know we're yet! I'm not sure I'm ready for that. And besides he's not gonna be too happy to see me either."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "I don't know if I've told you this, but he's kinda tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Yeah, he's made phone calls, written letters, he even came to New York, but I always said I was too busy to see him. Y'know it's all very Cats in the Cradle-I don't want to get into it. Here we go."

  },

    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Oh my God! You did too? It totally freaked me out, what was that?!"

    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Oh come on, by age seven kids have already seen orgies. Was it just me?!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "No-no! I'm fine. It's just... Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you've known for a while and then suddenly...suddenly see them a different way?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I'm talking about."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Hey, did you get to the part where they're trapped in the car and Cujo's throwin' himself at the windshield?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "No! No! Seriously, what's wrong with the dog?! Wait a minute, what are you doing home so early? What happened to your date?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Y'know, I never thought I'd say this about a movie, but I really hope this dog dies. What are you doing over there? Come sit here, you protect me."

    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Okay. Okay, that's him! That's him! That's Cujo! That's Cujo!"

    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Oh my God....What's he gonna do now? I can't watch! Oh. Seriously, how can you watch this? Aren't you scared?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "So is everybody here? I got here a little early myself. Let us begin. Now, the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations. Here. Here. Now as for the hydrosaurs..."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Really? What do you do? You just sit in there stewing in your own filth."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "How dirty do you think I am? I'm telling you, if you had some candles and some bubbles and some music, you would love it! It would take all of your stress away."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Honey, it's 2:00 on a Wednesday and I'm watching Road Rules, how stressed do you think I am?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Hey, Chandler, you got a minute? I-I really need to talk to you."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Oh! Uh, yeah! Is this a cold pizza talk or a leftover meatloaf talk?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "I don't know. It's-it's just...lately, I've been feeling... Okay, here's what it is... You know what? I feel a lot better, thanks!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me."
  },

    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Hi! Oh, Ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "No-no, we talked about it. We don't want to know. All we care about is that it's happy and healthy."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Huh. That's a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Well, OK, it's for a boy. Well, I know it's a little out there, but...Darwin."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Oh! I'm sorry! Are we having an 89-year-old? How about Dayton?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "No, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Honey, I don't like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "All right, this isn't so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I've got my boat."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Dr. Long",
    "dialogue": "Okay! All your tests look fine. Now, are you two interested in knowing the sex of the baby?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it's a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Dr. Long",
    "dialogue": "Oh, I'll be right back. And, uh, I know it's really not my place, but please don't name your child Phoebo."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "What? Rach! Come on, that's terrible! They're...uh...they're babies. They're-they're all beautiful."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Yeah, why is it staring at me? I think it knows I'm talking about it. Don't-don't you-Wh-Wha-Hey!!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know! I swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know! It was just a momentary lapse."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there's something wrong."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water's tepid. The salt didn't dissolve and is now... lodged places. And the scents I used don't compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile-Oh!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "The bath salts! They're starting to effervesce! It's different. It's interesting."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and..."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "I don't know! Joey hasn't had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "I mean, I-I, I really shouldn't say. I mean, I'm really not supposed to."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "I guess that makes sense. So, you think you're going to talk to him?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Sure, yeah. I mean, it's Joey. I don't want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "You know what? I've been thinking about it. I'm really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "I don't think so! You're just giving me Ruth so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Yes, and I'm sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that's very rare."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it's Rachel for God sakes."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y'know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don't like about her. You want to hear it?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "She made me switch to light Mayo. That's it! That's all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Absolutely! Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "That's right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I've had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I'm sure you've had them for us."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "So, I uh... I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe it's with you-But still! We're having a girl!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "I know! I know. You know what? I'm putting Ruth back on the table!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Yeah, I'm going to take a bath. I'm just going to get a magazine."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "I know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you're just a girl in a tub!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "She pulled it out of me! She's like a conversational wizard! How'd it go?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Yeah! How would you like it if I sent you to Lee Majors' house and told you that he liked you, and you went down there and you found out that he didn't like you? How would you feel?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Oh my God! A friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong. It's Rachel!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "It's no big deal, okay? Phoebe and I talked about it. It's just a crush! It's going to go away! Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles! Oh!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Hey! Ross and I were looking for you! What are we all doing in here? Oh, my!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Well hey! What's going on? Ooh, cool boat--Oh, no. Hey, did you, did you tell them?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Oh my God! You're getting a massage! You never let me massage you!!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Oh okay, okay! One more push! One more push! Come on honey, we're almost there! We're almost there!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Oh Joey, I'm so happy things worked out for us that we're having this baby together. I love you so much."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "And I hope it's not an inappropriate time to say this but, you're the best sex I ever had."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "That's always appropriate! Oh, okay. One more push! One more push!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Joey! The baby is kicking for the first time! Will you please come feel this?!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",

    "dialogue": "Hey! A dog! Hi! Who, you got to admit, looks a lot like Jane."
  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn't going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat."
  },

    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Hey, buddy. How's my favorite dog, huh? How's my favorite dog? You're subdued. Did you give him a beer?"

  },
  {
    "character": "Mona",
    "dialogue": "No, no. Listen, Ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment, and, and, we gotta have some boundaries, so why don't you go back to your place and give us some privacy?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "That's better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it...except all I did was think about it."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "You know, it haunts me? Up 'til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Hi! I'm so sorry to barge in on your Valentine's, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross."

  },

  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends."

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on."
  },
  {
    "character": "The Interviewer",
    "dialogue": "So, that's it. I guess that's all I need. Thank you so much. I think they will be running this in the beginning of next month."
  },
  {
    "character": "The Interviewer",

    "dialogue": "Excellent! Let's play Bamboozled! Chandler, you'll go first. What is the capital of Columbia?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "It's Ba-go-ta, but close enough. Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross or pick a Wicked Wango card."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "I should know that. Let's see, just one moment please. Umm, here we are, a Wicked Wango card determines whether you go higher or lower."
  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "No look, we've apologized twice! I can't do anymore than that. I know you hate it when people are mad at you but you just have to be okay with it."
  },
  {
    "character": "Sandra Green",
    "dialogue": "Look at that face! Just like when you were in high school! If I didn't know better I'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble. Come on, let's get some tea."
  },
  {
    "character": "Sandra Green",
    "dialogue": "Oh my look at that. Only three weeks to go, now have you picked your nanny yet? Now I don't want you to use your housekeeper 'cause it would just split her focus."

  },
  {
    "character": "Sandra Green",
    "dialogue": "It's like you're a cave person. Rachel, you must get a nanny. You don't know how overwhelming this is going to be. I mean when you were a baby I had full time help, I had Mrs. Kay."
  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Wait a minute, I-I believe I'm entitled to use my Angel Pass for a free turn?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "All right. Chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a Google card."
  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Jack Geller",

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",

  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "But I-I was going to see if y'know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that-I mean that-that was all, Rach."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Oh that's right. There's a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier."

  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Okay, well, that... Wow, okay, well, umm...then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again."

  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",

    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?"

    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",

  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",

  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Except that! Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon."
  },

    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour."
  },
  {
    "character": "Mr. Zelner",
    "dialogue": "Well, then Gavin can give the presentation, okay, we have to do it now. Ralph needs to leave early today. He's going helicopter shopping."
  },

    "character": "Gavin Mitchell",
    "dialogue": "Because you've worked really hard, and it's your job, and you're a little crazy."

    "dialogue": "Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. \"Pants. Like shorts, but longer.\" It'll probably be more than a year."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration."

  },
  {
    "character": "Dr. Drake Ramoray",

  },

    "dialogue": "OK, I don't want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just saw a rat in your cupboard."
  },

    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies."
  },
  {
    "character": "Mike Hannigan",
    "dialogue": "You can't keep a rat in your appartment! They're extremely unsanitary, and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus."

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",

  },
  {
    "character": "Gavin Mitchell",

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",

  },

    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "It was ... oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just \"Tag\". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses."

    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!"
  },

    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it."

  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over."
  },
  {

    "dialogue": "Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?"
  },

    "dialogue": "Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve around their rats?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Mike Hannigan",
    "dialogue": "Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when they mate and there are hundreds of them?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Mike Hannigan",
    "dialogue": "Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they're more of a \"love the one you're with\" kind of animals."
  },
  {
    "character": "Mike Hannigan",
    "dialogue": "Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let the box of rats ruin our lives."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites."

  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?"

    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",

    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken."
  },

  {
    "character": "Rachel",

  },
  {
    "character": "Steve",
    "dialogue": "It's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money. That's right. I have no money, I'm not funny, I live in a studio apartment with two other guys, and I'm pretty sure I'm infertile."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself."
  },

    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight."
  },
  {
    "character": "Waiter",
    "dialogue": "Eh, okay, the waiters have a little pool going. We have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell."
  },

    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel."

    "dialogue": "Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Oh, we were playing \"peek-a-boo.\" She just - she loves it when I'm dramatic."

    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this."

    "dialogue": "Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name."
  },
  {
    "character": "Steve",

    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but..."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up."
  },

    "dialogue": "The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid."
  },

    "character": "Joey",

  },

    "dialogue": "I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Waiter",
    "dialogue": "Guys, give it a rest. Nobody's betting on you tonight. Although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people... come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating."
  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",

    "dialogue": "Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want."
  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",

    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it..."

  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you."
  },
  {
    "character": "Mike Hannigan",
    "dialogue": "Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material..."

  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",

    "dialogue": "You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... OUCH!"

  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",

  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",

  },

    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Yeah it is really pricey. I mean, I freaked when I first heard the numbers."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "It was pretty simple actually, I came up with a couple of cost-cutting solutions, wrote out a list and Monica told me to go to hell."
  },

    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "There's no way around it Pheebs, you just gonna have to accept the fact that this is gonna cost you a lot of money."
  },
  {
    "character": "Mike Hannigan",
    "dialogue": "I heard that weddings are like a 40 billion dollar a year industry."
  },

  },

  },

    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Kind of. She's coming by to interview us and see where we live."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "And it has to go perfectly, because if she doesn't like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Hey, maybe I should stop by! She could be a soap opera fan! It's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Ok, so I think I'm just about done here, unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like... porn or cigarettes?"
  },

    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Ok, so there's not a magazine under the couch, or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank, or a filthy video in the VCR?"

    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "I'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine, but that tape is not mine."

    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Look, I'm sorry to hear about your tragedy, ok? But the swings are perfectly safe, and besides Emma loves them. You know what, you should come with us and you'll see!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Ross, those things go like 40 miles an hour! Ok? When you're... and there is that moment when you are at the top, when you just don't know if you're gonna return back to earth!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",

  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. Plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",

  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",

    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "2 minutes, 12 pies and a part of one tin! Okay, I see you guys at 4."

    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Okay, but, well, before you say no, my friend Susanne is entering her kid and compared to Emma she's a real dog!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another, I mean, you know, and judging who's cuter just for a trophy..."
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "...is something I'm very interested in! Oh please, do not tell Ross. He still believes that what's in the inside is important..."
  },

    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Yeah, but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "I'm telling ya! It's gonna happen. Next year it's gonna be you, me and the little Hemingway Bing. What, he's my favourite author!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Ok, let's see... uhm, okay, the turkey is in the oven, the stuffing is ready..."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "You know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. Let me help this year."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Oh, Chandler, that's sweet. But you don't have to do everything Doctor Phil tells you to do."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "I'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing \"high profile\"."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Ok, let's see... Oh, the cranberry sauce, it is easy to make and no-one really cares about it."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Okay, I'm gonna go check on something across the hall. You start by washing these Not with soap!!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "You say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Look, Monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Oh Phoebe, listen. Well, I think we gotta go. This place is really freaking me out. I've been watching this guy over there, I don't think he came with a kid!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "We can't leave now! There was this one baby, Haley, who was favourite to win and she got croup, so she had to stay home! This competition just blew wide open, folks!"

    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Phoebe, I think... It's just too weird, I just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on!"

  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",

  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "I know, I know! When I was here for Holidays on Ice I was sitting so far away Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Wow, hey, we'd better get going. If we don't leave right now, we'll be late for dinner."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Oh, but it's a kind game! So we're a little late, you know, the girls will be there, let's stay just for one more goal."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "I can't believe they are not here! I slave and I slave for what? They've ruined cranberry day!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Okay. Rachel and Phoebe are already there, okay? So they probably started without us. We could just slip in and no-one needs to know where we were!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You just want to put it on your hand!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",

  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",

    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "You guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",

  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",

  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Oh, good, that's good, but you don't look like you were mugged!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Ohhh! Let me see! Oh God, I can't believe this! They're an hour late and they're just staying out there, talking!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Everything is so distorted! Looks like Joey has a giant hand! Which says \"Rangers\" on it. They went to the game!"
  },

  },
  {
    "character": "Rachel",

  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Oh my God! YOU FORGOT THE PIES? Well, I cannot believe this. You force me to make dinner, then you're an hour late and you forget the one little thing that I asked you to do."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Well, you manheads aren't any better. You lied about going to the game. You knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Hey! I'm getting a little tired of this okay? We said we're sorry. It's Thanksgiving for Pete's sakes! A day of forgiveness!"

    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Uhm... you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet."
  },

    "character": "Mike Hannigan",
    "dialogue": "You're right. She probably will support me. Hey, unless we move in with you, dad?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Mike didn't tell you? You have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. One of his groomsmen fell out."
  },

    "dialogue": "Well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between Ross and Chandler. So good luck with that."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "It's 2101 and I am not amused. . Ok, the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Oh, man! I wouldn't have had breakfast if I knew there was going to be corsages!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Hi. About last night... I know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit... My point is, uh, well, I'm willing to take my job back."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Oh, well that's ok. I think you and I will do much better if you're just... here as a bridesmaid."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Uh-huh, but I'm sure you can handle this. I mean, I have won awards for my organizational skills, but, uh, I'm sure you'll do fine."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "I have to talk to her about this groomsman situation, ok? I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there while I'm sitting in the seats like some chump! . Oh! My God! You're breathtaking!"

    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Oh, Ross, c'mon, please! Don't make this harder than it already is!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "Listen, listen. Whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you! Now, I promise I won't say a word, but if you pick Chandler he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Sven I don't understand what you're saying! What is wrong with the flowers? Lorkins? What the hell are lorkins?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Listen, Mike, if you were Swedish and you were saying the word \"lorkins\" what flowers would that be?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Have a seat. Last night, I tried to welcome you into my family... and instead, you disrespect me... I cannot allow this."

    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "That's what I wanted to hear! Because she's family, ok, and now you're gonna be family, and there is nothing more important in the whole world, than family."
  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Hey, can I talk to you about this groomsman thing? If you pick Ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. But if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "No! We're gonna do it my way. Because your way is stupid! Alright I gotta go, I have another call, Reverend. Hello?"
  },

    "character": "Mike Hannigan",
    "dialogue": "Yes. Yeah and thanks for all the wedding night advice. That didn't make me uncomfortable at all! Alright, so I'll see everybody tonight?"

  },
  {
    "character": "Mike Hannigan",
    "dialogue": "Oh, you haven't picked yet. Oh good, 'cause I had an idea. I thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog. Chappy."
  },

    "character": "Rachel",
    "dialogue": "Wow, this is a tough one. I think I'm gonna have to go with the dog."

    "dialogue": "I gotta say, I have not had sex a lot of times before, this is the worst ever."
  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",

  },
  {
    "character": "Ross",
    "dialogue": "That's right, sex is off the table. I am never having sex with you again. Dr. Green, are you feeling better?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Erica",
    "dialogue": "We had a good time. By the way, I wanted to ask you something. It would really mean a lot to me, if the baby was a boy, that you name him after my father, Jiminy Billy Bob."
  },
  {
    "character": "Erica",
    "dialogue": "No! You we're right, that was fun! I'm gonna go finish packing."
  },
  {
    "character": "Erica",

    "dialogue": "It's a shame though, I mean, when we did it, it was pretty good."

    "dialogue": "You know what? You are my friends, I wanna be supportive, I will come with you. SHOTGUN!"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "What? No, the only reason I'm going to their stupid new house, is so I can point out everything that's wrong with it, so they don't move. I'm gonna make them stay here."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Joey, you can't make someone do something they don't want to do. Believe me, there's something I've been trying to get Mike to do in bed and there's... he's just..."
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "All right, prude... Look, Monica and Chandler really love this house. You are not gonna talk them into staying here."

  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Okay, well, I just don't, I don't know how it works exactly. See, my name is Buffay and my husband's name is Hannigan, so is it supposed to be Buffay-Hannigan or Hannigan-Buffay?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Phoebe",
    "dialogue": "Wrong again! Apparently you can change it to anything you want. So I thought, all right, here's an opportunity to be creative. So meet Princess Consuela Banana Hammock."
  },

    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "You know, I always feel that way after an interview. I'll bet it went better than you think."

    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "No it's not. We had an inspection and they didn't find anything."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Okay. Then I guess I have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason."
  },
  {
    "character": "Monica",
    "dialogue": "Maybe because it's you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here."
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Maybe. So this is the living room huh? Ooh, it's pretty dark."
  },

    "dialogue": "When your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?"
  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",

  },
  {
    "character": "Joey",

  },

    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and then years later, they'll find each other and be reunited. I mean, that's a great day for everybody."

  },
  {
    "character": "Chandler",
    "dialogue": "Maybe. Unless they're like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they're pushed through a vagina and they meet."

  },

  },

    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Maybe that's okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you've been trying to for so long, maybe now that you're on different continents.. Right?"

    "character": "Joey",

    "dialogue": "You didn't bring one! My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport."
  },

    "character": "Joey",
    "dialogue": "Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?"
